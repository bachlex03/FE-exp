# Redux Ecosystem Playground

This is a comprehensive playground for exploring and testing various state management and data fetching libraries in the React/Next.js ecosystem.

## 🚀 Purpose
This project is designed to experiment with and demonstrate the usage of:
- **Redux** & **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**
- **Redux Thunk** & **Redux Saga**
- **Redux Persist**
- **RTK Query**
- **React Query** (TanStack Query)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Library**: [React 18](https://react.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## 📂 Configuration Notes
- **Import Alias**: This project uses `~/*` mapping to the `src/` directory.
- **Tailwind v4**: PostCSS configuration is optimized for Tailwind v4 using `@tailwindcss/postcss`.

## 🏃 Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
